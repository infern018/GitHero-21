"Develop", as the name suggests, is normally used as a kind of staging environment, or testing environment, into which all new feature/hotfix branches will be merged to establish the effects of the new code, good or bad, before it would be allowed to be merged to the "master" branch.

Always make sure the new changes don’t break anything before pushing them to github
